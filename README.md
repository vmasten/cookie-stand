# Salmon Cookie Project
A project to demonstrate proficiency with JavaScript objects, the DOM, building tables, and more.

Currently, it uses store objects to calculate how many cookies are sold per day and displays them in a table in sales.html. Stores can be added to the table via a form built in HTML/JavaScript, and there are multiple mockups of pages describing the company with text from a lorem ipsum generator.
