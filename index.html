    <p>A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk. We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. All you have to learn here is how to have fun. Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy. Now then, let's play. See there how easy that is. You create the dream - then you bring it into your world. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. At home you have unlimited time.</p>
    <p>Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that. Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. Anyone can paint. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. It’s about to freeze me to death. I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. We don't want to set these clouds on fire. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun We'll paint one happy little tree right here. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things.</p>
